    <StyledP>
      I've had over 4 years experience working as a developer and consultant for
      clients such as Cond√© Nast, HSBC, Freshfields, and insurethebox (Toyota).
      I enjoy working with clients to architect and build Web Apps that are
      modern, high-performing, and adhere to programming best practices.

    <StyledP>
      I'm passionate about tooling and optimising DX. I care more about the
      product than the technology used and love working with anything in the
      extended JS ecosystem that helps developers build great apps.
