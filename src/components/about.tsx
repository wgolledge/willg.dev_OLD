        I've had over 4 years experience working as a developer and consultant
        for clients such as Cond√© Nast, HSBC, Freshfields, and insurethebox
        (Toyota). My skillset is tilted towards front-end, though I have code in
        production across the whole stack.

        I'm passionate about tooling and optimising DX. While I care more about
        the product than the technology used, I love working with JavaScript
        (and React‚ù§Ô∏è). I value the importance of making things{' '}
        {<Italic>fast</Italic>} so have been upskilling in Golang and WorkboxüöÄ.

      If you notice the lack of a 'blog posts' section; that's because I've
      always been much more of an avid blog-reader than blog-writer. Maybe
      that's something I'll try to change over the next year.

      That's pretty much it! Thanks for dropping by. If you'd like to get in
      touch come and find me using the links below.
